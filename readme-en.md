and under 2020 version likes:  
except wifi couldnt be load,everything is as same as 2019 version,works fine.

## How to disable CFG lock：


upgrade your bios to 1.27,could be download in HUAWEI's official page  

1. Format a usb memory to fat32  

2.create a new floder named "EFI" at root  

3.create a new floder named "BOOT" At /EFI  

4.download cfgunlock.zip  

5.copy bootx64.efi from cfgunlock.zip to EFI/BOOT in your usb 

Restart and boot with this usb  

After you boot   

Press alt and "+" in same time  

And use ↑and↓ in your keyboard to find "cpusetup"  


And press enter in keyboard to enter "cpusetup"

Use ←→↑↓ key to pick it and press enter  

Then,put "00" in  

Then,press ctrl and w in same time to save setting   

If save successfully,it will tell you like"update written"(i forget it)

And you will get a perfect power management
